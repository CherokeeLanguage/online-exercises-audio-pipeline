default		0	7144	7144	After combining her passions for jewelry and art, Cherokee Nation citizen Jae Anthony-Wilson taught herself how to bead in early 2020.
default		7144	14266	7122	Her new talent gave her an outlet of self expression, as well as allowed her to connect with herself on a creative and spiritual level.
default		14266	19787	5521	“Beadwork has always been something really special to me and a way that I express myself.
default		19787	23920	4133	I’ve always throughout my life expressed myself with my jewelry and the beadwork that I own.
default		23937	27377	3440	But I always wanted to learn and I’ve always been an artist,” she said.
default		27425	33969	6544	With attending college, Anthony-Wilson said her creative outlets took a back seat, but that changed in 2020.
default		33969	39514	5545	“I kind of got dragged away from my art … but during the pandemic, I just had time to slow down,” she said.
default		39514	43201	3687	“I think that we all kind of maybe went through some hard stuff alone.
default		43201	47953	4752	Although it was hard, it gave me an opportunity to reconnect with myself and reconnect with my art.
default		47953	52366	4413	I just started beading and I taught myself actually on YouTube from another Native artist.”
default		52366	58080	5714	Her first pairs of earrings were a tribute to her sisters, of which she is the youngest of five.
default		58080	64204	6124	Anthony-Wilson said from there, her beading was showcased in an early 2020 art show and it “took off from there.”
default		64204	71550	7346	“I created my first pairs off of my sisters in my family and did like color combinations on how I feel about them,” she said.
default		71550	78536	6986	Anthony-Wilson describes her waterfall, or tassel, style of earrings as an “abstract, more modern” take on realistic imagery.
default		78536	81700	3164	“A whole lot of the time it’s not just design and pattern.
default		81700	85386	3686	It’s more like I’m copying a bird or I’m copying a flower,” she said.
default		85560	88002	2442	“So, it’s very realistic and image-like.”
default		88002	92929	4927	Some of her collections include her take on wildlife, flowers and even Tulsa architecture.
default		92929	97300	4371	When it comes to sharing her work with the world, Anthony-Wilson said it means “everything” to her.
default		97670	100610	2940	She added that beading allows her time to “connect” to herself.
default		100813	104721	3908	“I think it’s so important to connect with yourself and to take that time.
default		104721	108330	3609	Especially as Native Americans we have a lot of healing to do,” she said.
default		108330	116230	7900	“We have a lot of trauma and a lot of pain from the past, so to be able to have that time to sit with myself and just be with myself and be with my beads, it’s so healing.”
default		116230	122006	5776	As for being a Native creator, Anthony-Wilson said it is important that there is “raw, real Native representation.”
default		122006	126869	4863	“Growing up in a predominantly white suburb as a young, Native American girl was kind of tough.
default		126869	129016	2147	I got a lot of stereotypes thrown at me.
default		129016	132712	3696	People would touch my hair, just a lot of negative stereotypes,” she said.
default		132712	138640	5928	“So, to be a raw, real representation of a 21st century Cherokee woman is really important to me.
default		138640	146791	8151	I also want to inspire young Native artists and other Native Americans that maybe have been hit with those stereotypes as well and don’t feel as connected.
default		146791	150290	3499	Real representation is really important to me, so I try to be that.”
